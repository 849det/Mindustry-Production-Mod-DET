TODO:

Re-add research requirement for plastic-fighter-factory
Add more pages to the wiki
Redo example image
Add Ukrainian bundle
Fix conveyor graphics (something is very wrong with my image editting software)  (it seems good?)
Fix Base Infiltration? (probably not since I don't think there's any way for me to load it)
Better graphics?
More alternate recipes?



Decided against:

Add a way to get graphite w/o coal (titanium + lead?)  (there are already ways to get graphite w/o coal even on maps where there is no coal, you just have to get the right researches)
