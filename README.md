# Mindustry Production Mod
![GitHub Logo](/sprites/git/example.png)
This is a mod for Mindustry that gives you iron, steel, oil processing, and alternative ways of generating materials like titanium. This mod also makes the end-game sightly harder.

There are two ways to add this mod to your game.
- Method 1: Find your mods folder and move the folder containing this file to the mods folder.
- Method 2: Open Mindustry, go to the mods, go to import from github, and enter "What42Pizza/mindustry-production-mod".
