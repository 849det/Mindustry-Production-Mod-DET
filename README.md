# Mindustry-Production-Mod
This is a mod for the game Mindustry that adds more production. I'm not done with it and I'll most likely add much more.

There are two ways to add this mod to your game.
Method 1: Find your mods folder and move the folder that this file is in to the mods folder.
Method 2: Open Mindustry, go to the mods, go to import from github, and enter "What42Pizza/mindustry-production-mod".
