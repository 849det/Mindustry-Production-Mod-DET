# Mindustry-Production-Mod
![GitHub Logo](/sprites/git/example.png)
This is a mod for Mindustry that gives you iron, steel, oil processing, and alternative ways of generating materials like titanium. This mod also makes the end-game more interesting, because putting together two materials in one machine to get the most powerful material in the game is not interesting.

There are two ways to add this mod to your game.
- Method 1: Find your mods folder and move the folder containing this file to the mods folder.
- Method 2: Open Mindustry, go to the mods, go to import from github, and enter "What42Pizza/mindustry-production-mod".
